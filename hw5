The variables we focused on were Income and Education Level and the impact of Education Level on Income. The code for this goes as follows:


load("~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/B2000/Household_Pulse_data_ph4c2.RData")

set.seed(12345)

Household_Pulse_Filtered <- Household_Pulse_data %>%
  filter(ANYWORK == "yes employment in last 7 days" & !is.na(INCOME) & !is.na(EEDUC))


Household_Pulse_Filtered$EEDUC_Number <- as.numeric(as.factor(Household_Pulse_Filtered$EEDUC))



model_education_income <- lm(INCOME ~ EEDUC_Number, data = Household_Pulse_Filtered)


summary(model_education_income)

Results and Findings: 

Based on the household pulse data, the focused topic on the linear regression was the impact of education level on Income. The null and alternative hypothesis goes as follows:

Null Hypothesis:  Education level has no effect on income
Alternate Hypothesis:  Education level has an effect on income

	Now based on the results of the linear regression, the p value is 2e-16 which is less than 0.05 , so it is clear to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that education has an effect on income.

The t-statistic is 88.35 which suggests that income is heavily dependent on education level.

Based on the confidence intervals, the conclusion still remains the same that income relies on education as an increase in education level will increase income by $17304.42 - $18089.63. The confidence level also tells us that when the education level is 0 (No education) , it is concluded that the income level will be around $11,624.31 - $16,034.74.
